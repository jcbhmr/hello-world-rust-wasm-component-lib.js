# JavaScript bindings for "Hello world!" Rust WebAssembly component library

🟪 Rust library compiled to WASM and distributed as a [WASM component]

```js
run();
//=> Hello Alan Turing!

console.log(getReport());

🦀 Written in Rust \
[🟨 Usable in JavaScript](./hello-world-rust-wasm-component-lib.js/) \
🌎 Runs on any [WebAssembly Component Runtime]

## Installation

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=JavaScript&color=222222&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=F7DF1E&label=)

The easiest way to get started is by using one of these wrapper libraries that
already have all of the WASM host imports resolved.

For JavaScript users, you can use npm, [pnpm], [Yarn], or your other favorite
npm package manager to install [`hello-world-rust-wasm-component-lib` from npm].

```sh
npm install hello-world-rust-wasm-component-lib
```

If you prefer to customize the Javascript ↔ WASM component bindings, you can
use [bytecodealliance/jco] to generate your own bindings.

## Usage

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=JavaScript&color=222222&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=F7DF1E&label=)

You can use any [WASM host runtime for components]. You can find the API surface
and any imports you need to provide in [`wit/world.wit`](wit/world.wit).

For language-specific binding documentation, check out
[hello-world-rust-wasm-component-lib.js].

## Development

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

```sh
wget https://github.com/jcbhmr/hello-world-rust-wasm-component-lib/releases/download/v1.0.0/hello_world_rust_wasm_component_lib.wasm \
  -O /tmp/hello_world_rust_wasm_component_lib.wasm
jco transpile /tmp/hello_world_rust_wasm_component_lib.wasm -o . \
  --map print=./print.js
```

ℹ You'll need [`wasm-tools`] installed which you can get via
`cargo install wasm-tools`.

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.reactor.wasm` is the adapter module to shim the
component API over top of the existing WASI API. Keep it updated from
[bytecodealliance/wasmtime releases]. Since this is a library we want the
"reactor" version.

🚚 To create a new release, don't use the GitHub UI directly; use the [draft
release] GitHub Actions workflow to create the initial draft release with the
compiled WASM artifact. Then you can edit that release and publish it as normal.
Make sure the `version` fields are correct before drafting the release; it's
used to choose the `v${version}` tag name for the release and in publishing.
Also try not to change the artifacts attached to the draft release; they were
generated by GitHub Actions.
